# Brain-Stroke-Detection
This project is a machine learning-based system that predicts the likelihood of a brain stroke based on various health and lifestyle factors. It aims to assist in early detection, enabling quicker medical response and potentially saving lives.
Features:
1.Predicts stroke risk using patient data
2.Cleaned and preprocessed dataset
3.Trained ML model (e.g., Random Forest, Logistic Regression, etc.)
Technologies Used:
1.Language: Python
2.Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Dataset:
The dataset was sourced from Kaggle, consisting of features such as:
Age
Hypertension
Heart Disease
Avg Glucose Level
BMI
Smoking Status
Model Performance:
Accuracy: 95%
